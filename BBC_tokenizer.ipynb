franz ferdinand  travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world  so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods!  i think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state  the answer is most definitely no. those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn t be looking for government subsidies. i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship.  yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.  there are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around  twiddling their thumbs on the  new deal . getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.  as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move. i would hate to see more pop idol-type funding of music though  as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about.  only if the proposals make financial sense. franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they d had a government grant to get started they d have more than paid it back by now  so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out. however  the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they re a musician. the government shouldn t  fund  music - it should  invest  in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.  i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. however  i do feel this should be the extent of their role  to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.  i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately  the directors are in the business for! if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn t have to fork out a great deal.  yeah  why not  music should be government funded  particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff. pop music pretty much rules the earth  so more attention should go to the other fraternities  i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. there is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol-style music - that is  the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. call it a tax on music  pollution   if you like.  though i really like franz ferdinand  i have to disagree with mr kapranos. once government gets their hand into the private sector  it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. many years ago  this was the case with the us nea  when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations  like save the music in the us.']\n",

            "['business', 'why few targets are better than many the economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in 2000 were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the world s leading economy by 2010.  but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige. for many economists and analysts they are about ensuring europe doesn t become a global economic laggard. they are also about ensuring europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of asia  india and china  as well as with the economic might of the united states. that s why there was a tone of urgency in the report  out on wednesday  by the former dutch prime minister wim kok. mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets  five years on from their inception. his conclusion was simple: too many of the targets will be seriously missed.  lisbon risks becoming a  synonym for missed objectives and failed promises   his report said.  the status quo is not an option.   at risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built  it said. the report comes at a time when europe s competitive position is waning. the eu s economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next. while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe  productivity lags behind that of the us. but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far. that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years.  as mr kok s report noted:  the ink had scarcely dried on the [lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded.   the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit.   the circumstances weren t conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in 2000. neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development  money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a so-called  knowledge-based economy .  the [lisbon] vision is a compelling one  but in order to do it society has to change   said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council  a brussels-based citizen action group.  what you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change. you find trade unions fighting change. but also the employers  associations.  even though they tell you they re in favour of change  many are actually pushing for less competition  more subsidy and less free market activity.   but part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago. targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case  they covered too much  according to the wim report. economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion  and even safety at sea. the agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised.   lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing   the kok report said.  everybody is responsible and thus no one.  that s why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators  with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. it also recommends that the european commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they re taking towards meeting the targets  effectively  naming  shaming and faming .  rhetoric and delivery don t necessarily go hand in hand   mr kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report.  we don t have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another.   on one point mr kok was very clear: the european union should not try to emulate the us economy. the european economic and social model needs to change  but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth. in that sense  the lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters. the kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth.  it s very ambitious   said john palmer  political director at the european policy centre  a brussels-based think-tank.  this is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do. it s going to require quite new and innovative policies.  but some analysts believe that the kok report doesn t come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets a reality. for example  it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce. but it doesn t say how companies should be convinced to do this. it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission  jose manuel barroso  to adopt mr kok s recommendations and press them on eu governments. mr barroso has said that the eu s competitiveness will be his top priority. he expects his five-year term in office to be judged on europe s success in meeting the lisbon agenda.']\n",

but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 15-0 hammering of england. new zealand headed to wales to meet a country in the midst of its first  golden age   and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides. an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed a 3-0 win in a hard-fought encounter at cardiff arms park  but post-match talk was dominated by a bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas. dallas said that deans was tackled short  but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed:  i did score that try in cardiff.   four of the 1905 all blacks went over to the newly formed  all golds  rugby league side soon after the tour  but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglo-welsh touring team in 1908. the first south africa tour of new zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-test series  starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the all blacks  inclusion of maori players. the awesome 1924-5 all black tourists became known as  the invincibles  after winning all 30 of their games in france  britain and ireland  including a crushing 19-0 victory over wales at st helen s. despite their success  the all blacks  2-3-2 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times  and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in 1928. employing the modern 3-4-1 scrum line-up against the new zealand  rover  system for the first time  south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn two-all. the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 lions tour (a series won 3-1 by new zealand)  the lions manager describing the tactic as  cheating   prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum.  the all blacks  1935 european tour started inauspiciously with an 11-3 loss to a swansea side inspired by teenage  schoolboy half-backs hayden tanner and willie davies. a thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales 13-12  although the winning try from geoffrey rees-jones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the build-up. new zealand s next visit to wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 8-3 to cardiff and drew 6-6 at swansea. the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park  but the teams were locked at 8-8 when a clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for a famous  match-winning try. the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations  before a 19-5 success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller. new zealand built from that tour  and by the time they returned in 1963-4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world.  that made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely 3-0 win over the tourists at rodney parade. wilson whinneray s side rallied to beat wales 6-0  their first win at the arms park in four attempts  and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour  but when they returned home the first question put to them was:  what happened in newport   the only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with east wales  as they beat the full wales team 13-6 in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in 1969  the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team.  a ferocious game at the arms park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the all blacks  a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james-inspired lions of 1971.  james guided llanelli to a famous 9-3 win over the tourists at stradey park  though  and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks 23-11 in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. new zealand defeated a wales xv 12-3 at the arms park in a non-cap game in 1974  but it was the 1978 game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.  wales were leading 12-10 with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from a line-out. television pictures clearly showed that he dived  but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty  duly converted by brian mckechnie for a 13-12 win. since that infamous game  the competition has largely left wales v new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game. a crushing 23-3 win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby union s 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come. the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside 49-6 in brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural world cup. the kiwis went on to claim the cup  and would inflict further misery on wales on their ill-fated 1988 tour of new zealand.  a young  talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners  but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them 52-3 and 54-9. after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games  wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game  but as his views were ignored he - along with a generation of wales  best players - chose to head north to rugby league.  a 34-9 win in cardiff followed for new zealand in 1989  and at the 1995 world cup wales  big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg. a crushing 42-7 kiwi triumph in wembley followed in 1997  and as wales  misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen. there was a temporary resurgence in the welsh game  but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiff s new millennium stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory.  a bruising 55-3 defeat followed for wales in hamilton in 2003 as hansen built towards the world cup  but in australia it was a remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope. wales were given no chance going into the game  but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 37-33 early in the second half. new zealand rallied to a 53-37 win  but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future. they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen  coming to europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season. an encouraging display against south africa has inspired a confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years. they have a chance  but clearly history is not on their side.']\n",

wow this is a pretty interesting audience. the audience is pre-selected. they have decided to subscribe to your program   explains curry. advertising  in his eyes  can be tailored to podcasts  to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive.  how i believe this will work  is to create a network that  in aggregation  will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters.  i have 50  60  70 000 listeners. i could make a couple of bucks off that  but not much. if you are talking a million podcasters  and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves  then that is kind of interesting.  essentially  he says  if you are doing a bass fishing podcast  someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show. he is clear the ads will not be the traditional  in-your-face  type familiar to commercial radio now.  we are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place.   it is happening already. coffee-loving curry has sold $4 000 worth of coffee machines through a referral link to amazon from his site.  others use in-show promotions  like the dawn and drew show. one  eric rice  has won sponsorship from warner bros. he can now legally play the music of a band warner bros wants to push. some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days. others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative. one thing is for sure; they are not about to disappear in a hurry. the creative forces behind radio are elated  says curry. for now  he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community.  i should be knighted for this   he adds  with a wry chuckle   people are going to be so happy to sit at home  make their podcast  and make a little money.']\n",

believed to be battle angel alita. the game s visual quality would be  like a lucid dream   said mr cameron. but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists  and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop. the first new console  microsoft s xbox 2  is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005. games typically take at least 18 months to create  however  so developers are grappling with the hardware today.  according to robert walsh  head of brisbane-based game developer krome studios  next generation games will cost between $10-25m to make  with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title. such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio  said mr walsh.  if you re a start-up  i doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for $10m  however good you are   he said. mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds  since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games.  one developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright  the creator of the best-selling the sims games. the founder of california s maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game  spore. spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures. starting with an amoeba-sized organism  the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs  jaws and other body parts evolve.  eventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities  trading and fighting  and even building space ships. advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other spore players. these worlds will be automatically swapped across the internet. mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game.  i don t want to put the player in the role of luke skywalker or frodo baggins - i want them to be george lucas or dr seuss   explained mr wright. few games have hinted at the scope of spore  but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers. instead of employing lots of artists to create 3d models of the digital creatures  spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers.  the thing i am coming away with [from the conference] is that next generation content is going to be really expensive  and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market   said mr wright.  i d like to offer an alternative to that.   new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games  and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference.  oxford-based natural motion launched endorphin v2.0  which enables artists to direct a 3d  virtual actor . the actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics. endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs  for instance  or crumples up after a gunshot. artists can blend together these visual sequences  and include the results in their games. the process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand  and so lessens the need for larger art teams. another british company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is manchester start-up genemation. its latest tool  gencrowd  enables artists to create unique  photo-realistic human faces for games involving lots of people. gencrowd works by blending together elements of an in-built supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities. the software can create up to 2 000 new heads an hour.  one area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games. even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago  so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices.  the game developers conference included a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games. a niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago  gdc s mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates. mobile games are a fast-growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound  and are thus more suitable for playing games. furthermore  the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world. it s predicted that by 2006 two billion people will own a mobile phone. the growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by john batter  general manager at ea mobile. ea mobile is a division of electronic arts  the biggest games publisher. until recently electronic arts had been dismissive of games for phones.  the last time you checked  ea wasn t in this business   mr batter admitted. but he said ea now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of its most popular franchises. ea plans to release up to 20 mobile games over the next 12 months. the first will be a version of its need for speed racing game  created by ea mobile s 30-person development team. mr batter predicted that by 2006  mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on sony s upcoming psp handheld console.  owain bennallack is the editor of develop magazine.']\n",

arrest  where there isn t enough evidence to put them on trial.  lord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties. but thriller writer frederick forsyth tells bbc news of his personal response to the move.    there is a mortal danger aimed at the heart of britain. or so says home secretary charles clarke. my reaction  so what  it is not that i am cynical or just do not care. i care about this country very much.  but in the 66 years that i have been alive  there has not been one hour  of one day  of one month  of one year  when there has not been a threat aimed at us. my point is  the british have always coped without becoming a dictatorship. we have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear; we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat. but that is what the blair government now seeks to do - create a tyranny to defend us from the al-qaeda tyranny.  i was born on 25 august  1938. the mortal threat back then was a scruffy little austrian called adolf hitler. a week after my first birthday  the threat had become reality. we were at war. my father wore a uniform for five years. after 1945 we yearned for peace at last. but in 1946 winston churchill told us - from the baltic to the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across europe. behind the iron curtain  another genocidal psychopath  another threat. josef stalin triggered the cold war  with the berlin blockade in 1948. my whole generation was blighted by it.  we were threatened by the nuclear holocaust  the nuclear wind  the nuclear winter. we built shelters that would have sheltered nothing. we spent our treasure on weapons instead of hospitals. we took silly precautions. some fought it; some marched futilely against it. some pretended it was not there. the cold war lasted 43 years  but we remained a parliamentary democracy. by the early seventies it was terrorism as well. al fatah  black september  red brigades  but most of all for us the ira and the inla. thirty more years; 300 policemen and women  over 600 soldiers  more than 3 000 civilians dead  but we won because even ira bombs could not force us to become a tyranny. that was why the tyrants lost. civil rights were infringed as little as humanly possible. evidence had to be taken in secret to protect covert sources; yes   and one judge  no-jury courts had to be instituted when juries were terrorised. informants had to be given immunity from their own crimes to win the bigger battle. but habeas corpus did not die; right of appeal was not abolished. now the threat is islamic fundamentalism. its leaders want to destroy our society; so did the ira.  it is based and funded abroad; so was the ira. it has sleeper fanatics inside our society; so did the ira. it is extremely hard to penetrate with our agents; so was the ira. the prime movers are not easy to bring to trial; neither were the ira. but we did. and without becoming a tyranny. now the blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism. the citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial  not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge  but the whim of a political activist called a government minister. to be protected from terror the government says  we must become a tyranny. but a tyranny is based on the citizen s terror. this is not victory; this is defeat before a shot is fired.  an interesting article - its good to see widening participation in the debate - but i suggest we move one step further. our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace  because invading foreign nations  imprisoning the innocent and  hunting  in the  shadows  cannot destroy an evil of the mind  and hatred within the heart. rather than focusing upon effect  we should consider the cause  because terrorism does not begin with bombs. why not try a foreign policy of compassion  it can only enhance our democracy  and share our freedom.  i agree with frederick forsyth. we really can t deal with terrorism by turning britain into a fascist state. what we really need is more honesty from our security services and our politicians. if they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial  there probably isn t any. our security services  behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty  rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it  while the real villain gets away. remember there were no wmd in iraq. just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist.  in this overly  politically correct  society  it is good to see someone like mr. forsyth speak out. yes  there has been oppression by the british government in the past  and overstepping the mark in places like ireland  but yes  we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc. (apart from a number of prisoners in belmarsh goal  for example).this country signs up to human rights  and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear  the innocent people (defined by whom ). when id cards become mandatory  the data collected will not be protected by the data protection act  and will be readily available to people like gchq  with no control by the person whose id is being checked.  the threat now is new. you cannot compare the threats of past years with now. forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001. the threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology. a kilo of semtex will flatten a building  a kilo of plutonium will flatten a city. you now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible. i agree  the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.  the problem with this issue is not that it isn t important  but the fact that in general we brits can be so politically apathetic some times  that we will just let this go without telling the government no. however  as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty i hope this will prove to be one step too far.  as somebody of chinese origin  i can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life. whilst life wasn t perfect  we could make better for ourselves. now we are riddled with red tape and be told what we can or cannot do. we have to be politically-correct and we are not allowed to have beliefs or opinions. we have a prime minister who spends too much time meddling in us politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of british citizens at home or abroad. mr forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions. let s hope the bbc doesn t get gagged for letting people express their views. the people have the right to know and the bbc s role is to inform  educate and entertain...  i agree. terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear  by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties. in the end  the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy. the terrorists have already won.  i absolutely agree with frederick forsyth. yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but existing laws seem to be more than adequate. the idea that the  new terrorism  demands new powers is erroneous. the evidence of any real terrorist capability in the uk is scant. ricin  for example  is a dangerous poison but it is not a weapon of mass destruction. what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.  if the government has its way with id cards  tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not. we will have lost the precious freedom which bush and blair constantly tells us we have and that they seek to bring to others.  i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth. i am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court. that goes right back to magna carta  and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they  knew best .  when you look at today s britain  you realise george orwell was only wrong about one thing: the date.  frederick forsyth puts it beautifully. the government is seeking to introduce a police state. the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases  together with the un-british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years. we are sleep-walking into this. wake up!  an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance. these people will use devastating force against us without fear of any consequence. 2) the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it. because these terrorists are potentially so deadly  we have to come up with new  tougher responses. it will be a little late in the day when people outside london wake up one morning to find out that london has been nuked. we won t have much of a society left to debate !  he s correct in most of what he says. mind you he does seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in northern ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young catholics to join the ira. administrative detention of muslims could have a similar effect now.  surely we the public would be better protected if the security services  rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long )they were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack.  i don t usually have much time for mr forsyth s largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on. there is no doubt that there are terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the u.k. but it is very doubtful whether al-qaeda is a global organisation co-ordinating this. the rise of surveillance cameras  id cards  the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times  this is the stuff of nightmares. add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the home secretary  and i genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit. where will this end. as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the u.k. it s government will soon have it s people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.  mr forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation  but could not verbalise. thank you.  mr forsyth seems to forget that killings in the troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides. he also forgets basic human rights were suspended then as now. experienced judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those times. for very little return and maximum alienation. these laws and the emphasis on the islamic threat will just do the same.  forsyth is wrong. the nature of the current threat is new. it is no longer to our armed forces  as the soviet threat in the eastern bloc was. it is to you and i. the terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately. the best comparison is therefore the blitz  1941. at this time  let us not forget  suspects (foreign and british were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war  without any complaints from the public. we must not forget we are at war.  i d say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against a major uk target is a  when  not an  if  probability. i ll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didn t do enough to protect the uk. people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blair.  i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth. the very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live  is under attack  not from terrorists  but from this government. the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the  alleged  terrorists are doing  but from our own government. i believe what this government is doing  is  at the very least  highly questionable and at worst  sinister. at what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the british isles; when we are all tagged and monitored constantly  our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing. it should be of great concern to everyone.  i am slightly older than mr forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him. i am against a police state and would not like to think that i lived in one. i think that the attack on iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorism.  how true. there are extremely worrying parallels between britain now and germany during the 30 s. i never thought it would be so easy to take over a country from within.  mr forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler  stalin  and the ira all failed. as a result modern day terrorists are willing to do things their predecessors did not. that does not mean that the civil liberties of modern britain must be eroded to counter the threat; that should always be the absolute last resort. but to meet the new threat  to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today s terrorists  we may need to do things a little differently. let us hope not.  frederic forsythe s comments seem to me to be a well-thought-out analysis of why we (human society as a whole  and britain in particular) should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear. it is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end  and terrorists can come in all forms  as mr. forsythe s opening comments suggest.  i am reminded of a quote attributed to thomas jefferson.  a nation that limits freedom in the name of security will have neither.   the government are faced with an incredibly difficult task  and have made a policy to deal with it. it s all very well criticising that policy  but if mr forsythe can t draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative  i say  so what   to his opinions.  frederick forsyth s rhetoric is absurd and his conclusions laughable. he distorts reality to serve his own prejudice against new labour. this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights. it is frederick forsyth who is the extremist  because he does not appreciate the need for balance.  i rarely find myself agreeing with my forsyth  but in this instance i think he is correct. the rule of law must prevail  civil liberties are worth defending. if the government can hold  suspects  without charge or trial  what s next   i agree absolutely. by introducing fascist type laws we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror. our democratic system is not perfect  but as churchill points out it is  better than all the others that have been tried . terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom.  i do not usually agree with mr. forsyth  but he is spot on here. the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose. totalitarianism always requires an outside threat  justifying a range of extraordinary powers leaders want. the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.  although  in principle i agree with him  frederick forsyth fails to address one key point- al-qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the uk) seek to kill the maximum number of people. the ira wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movement.  yes  i agree with mr. forsyth s views. i do not believe the government s plans are justified. there is over reaction to and the negative influence of the us president s interpretation of democracy and freedom. he uses the same arguments that were current before the wwii  the wars to  liberate  iraq  afghanistan with syria and iran to come. we are leaving a poor inheritance for the future generations.  mr forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs. the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests. sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny  even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who  mr. forsyth seems to be putting along side the  scruffy little austrian.   thomas hobbes would be smiling in his grave at labour s propositions. like new labour  he called himself a libertarian. like new labour  he believed he was promoting the people s best interests. but as forsythe criticises this government  hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians. simply put  he argued that in favour of the ultimate liberty - the liberty to live - man should be prepared to surrender all other liberties to a supreme sovereign  as protection against his fellow  barbaric  man. hobbes has been roundly condemned by posterity  and rightly so. i hope new labour suffers the same treatment.  i agree with mr forsyth s views. the governments approach is totally against the spirit of british democracy. they must not be allowed to get away with it.  of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and he s wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny. has he forgotten about shoot to kill  torture  internment without trial  collusion with loyalist death squads etc   my background is somewhat similar to freddie s so i am persuaded to agree with many of his sentiments. we can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms.  whilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive  it is  unfortunately  also the first step towards totalitarianism. who is to decide whom is a suspect  why should we believe them  who can have faith in the honesty  integrity  and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years  what is to stop false denunciations  what of those falsely accused who will lose their careers  who will support their families  will their children still go to school  it smacks to me of the methods of nazi germany  stalin s russia  ceausescu s romania - the list goes on. it looks as if a new dark age is coming.  i see that opinion on mr forsyth s remarks are divided. the problem i see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family  only to people they don t like or are scared of. but history has shown that if you have laws like that  they always get abused by those in power. after all  today you may be scared of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you! and that day  you ll be the one imprisoned without the chance of justice. our laws are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces  you have to be shown to be deserving of it. if we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period  we are no better that those we are fighting.  i never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by frederick forsyth  but i m in wholehearted agreement with him on this one. we  as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda  which of course also means we ll inherit most  if not all of their total paranoia  and allow our governments  of any political persuasion incidentally  to gradually  and insidiously  impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods. i grieve for the future of my children  it s no wonder they re adamant they don t ever want any of their own.  this government  with much fanfare  signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial. this puts it on a par with the government of burma.  like many of your respondents  i wouldn t usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share  but in the instance of opposing charles clark s proposals for house arrest  i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth/  i agree with mr forsyth. just look at the facts - our government (along with the us) invaded another sovereign country (iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it s case based on fear. the facts turned out to be very different. if individuals are treated in the same distorted way  then we ve done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs. we become animals too.  i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent  it is hypocrisy of the highest order. mr forsyth links  islamic fundamentalism  to the new  threat . however it appears that he has misunderstood the term  islamic fundamentalism . it should be pointed out that a muslim who adheres to the true fundamentals of the qur aan and the teachings of the last prophet muhammad is an islamic fundamentalist. this person does not commit suicide in any shape or form  nor does she/he kill innocent women  men and children. this person is self-reflective and constantly tries to better her/his actions by being good to others. the people who mr forsyth labels the new  threat  are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam. they have arrived at their own interpretations and assumptions with regards their actions. on top of that  they claim to be following islam in its true form!  i accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in northern ireland internment certainly didn t achieve anything - the bombings didn t stop  and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the british.  being eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london  it is easy to agree with him  he is absolutely spot on. during the ira bombings there were massive explosions in canary wharf  to the right of where i write this  and also to the left in the city of london. notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on prime minister thatcher in brighton and on later occupants of 10 downing street  there was no retaliatory blitz on belfast or dublin as there has been on afghanistan and iraq. even when england was in true peril in 1940 apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like. we have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including id cards  which winston churchill decided had to go since  he said  the average bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities (incidentally i can still remember my old id card number). hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neutered.  what can i add to mr. forsyth s eloquently put arguments... except applause! well done that man for standing up and being counted in the  war against tyranny .']\n",

the result is a work in progress called  ipodder . doug kaye  a california-based podcaster  praises the former mtv vj for what he has done.  adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem. ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the mp3 player   he explains.  people can wake up in the morning  pick up their ipods as they go to work or before they go exercise  and discover that there s all this new content automatically put onto their players.  it is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in australia  finland  brazil  even malaysia. one couple broadcasts theirs  the dawn and drew show  from wisconsin in the us  sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed. topics range from the comfort of their bed  to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners.  already  websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts.  chris mcintyre runs podcast alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know-how to simply listen.  if i were to tell my mom  or my mother-in-law to copy an xml or rss file to their podcast aggregator  they would think i was speaking a foreign language   mr mcintyre says. along with technical challenges  there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite  albeit copyrighted  music. some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the  anti-radio  into something that is more like conventional broadcasting. already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world. heineken is doing its own podcast now  and so is playboy. for his part  adam curry s pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be. he loves doing the daily source code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences. he has even been called the ed sullivan or johnny carson of podcasting which  he says   is a badge i ll wear with great honour.  to be the johnny carson  or ed sullivan of anything is wonderful. and you know what  you don t need a hell of a lot of talent.  you just have to be nice  have your ears open  and let people shine. and that s good for me.   clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.']\n",

            "['tech', 'robotic pods take on car design a new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by japanese car giant toyota.  the company s vision for the single passenger in the 21st century involves the driver cruising by in a four-wheeled leaf-like device or strolling along encased in an egg-shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet. both these prototypes will be demonstrated  along with other concept vehicles and helper robots  at the toyota stand at the expo 2005 in aichi  japan  in march 2005. the models are being positioned as so-called personal mobility devices  which have few limits. the open leaf-like  i-unit  vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year. built using environmentally friendly plant-based materials  the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes. the model allows the user to make tight on-the-spot turns  move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds. body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music.  also on display at the show will be the egg-shaped  i-foot . this is a two-legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick.  standing at a height of well over seven feet (2.1 metres)  the unit can walk along at a speed of about 1.35km/h (0.83mph) and navigate staircases into the bargain. mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird-like legs that bend over backwards.  they are clearly what we call concept vehicles  innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production   said dr david gillingwater from the transport studies group at loughborough university.  they clearly have eye-catching appeal  which is in part the name of the game here  and are linked to the imac and ipod-type niche which apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years - new  different  hi-tech  image conscious products.  as always with these concept vehicles  it is difficult to see  who  they would appeal to and what their role would be in the  personal transport  marketplace.   the personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities. toyota s prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport. powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much us military research over the years and japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications. with an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population  care giving and the military  wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individual s particular mobility needs. while toyota s prototypes are geared towards mass transport  the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility.  experts  though  are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area.   those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance  now and certainly in the future  are the elderly and infirm people   dr gillingwater told the bbc news website.  you have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups.  design considerations also exist. dr erel avineri  of the centre for transport and society at the university of the west of england in bristol said:  the design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled.  for example  one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body  making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up.  it looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need. this and other human-factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered   said dr avineri.  in general  introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades. elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation.  this may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle.  such single-person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport.  the concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions   said dr gillingwater.  what s their range  how user-friendly will they really be  what infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used.  overall i think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions.']\n",

 calm down it s only in their opinion  and any list that includes the taser in the top 100 gadgets has to be suspect....  swiss army knife and no question about it. how many of the other items are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still as useful/popular  you don t need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out!  this list merely illustrates interesting cultural divides between the american authors and the overwhelmingly british responses. brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties sinclair; whilst the americans focus on apple  tv remotes and tivo (which probably is rather obscure in europe).  what about the soda stream. this gadget changed my pre-teen life. lap tops may enable you to  think different  but you cant use them to  get busy with the fizzy   how about astro wars  one of the pioneers for computer games  i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today! however tried it the other day and it was rubbish  still a great gadget of its time.  why worry about mobile phones. soon they will be subsumed into the pda s / laptops etc.  what about the marine chronometer  completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. for it s time  a technological marvel!  sony net minidisc! it paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. i always used my netmd  and could not go anywhere without it.  a laptop computer is not a gadget! it s a working tool!  the sinclair executive was the world s first pocket calculator. i think this should be there as well.  how about the clockwork radio  or gps  or a pocket calculator  all these things are useful to real people  not just pc magazine editors.  are the people who created this list insane   surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone  it has revolutionised communication  which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. from outside the modern age  the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget  without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly.  has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker    an interesting list. of the electronic gadgets  thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the tandy 100. the size of a4 paper and light  three weeks on a set of batteries  an excellent keyboard  a modem. a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible.  what s an apple powerbook 100   it s out of date - not much of a  gadget . surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener  swiss army knife  safety razor blade  wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves    it has to be the mobile phone. no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time.  the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule.  the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. a true gadget  it could be carried around and shown off.  all top 10 are electronic toys  so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anything else. i say this as the swiss army knife only made no 20.  sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time. the first home machine with a true multi-takings os. shame the marketing was so bad!!!  apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else.  utter rubbish. yes  the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets. but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer  gadgets  and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. no competition.  i d also put apple s newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing  and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason. i only wish that vulcan inc s flipstart wasn t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top.  how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)  what about radios and tvs   the swiss army knife. by far the most useful gadget. i got mine 12 years ago. still wearing and using it a lot! it stood the test of time.  psion organiser series 3  should be up there. had a usable qwerty keyboard  removable storage  good set of apps and programmable. case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first  i think). great product innovation.  the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile pc ! why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site  it s obviously the mobile phone or remote control  and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that.  the motorola startac should be number one. why  there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices.  the psion series 3c! the first most practical way to carry all your info around...  i too would back the sinclair spectrum - without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now.  i d have put the mobile phone high up the list. probably a nokia model.  sinclair spectrum - 16k. it plugged into the tv. games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that s what i do for a living now.  i wish more modern notebooks -- even apple s newest offerings -- were more like the pb100. particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball  which has given way to the largely useless  trackpad  which every notebook on the market today uses. they re invariably inaccurate  uncomfortable  and cumbersome to use.  congratulations to apple  a deserved win!']\n",

 it s all well and good robert kilroy-silk claiming  that  veritas  is a party that doesn t believe in  lies and spin   but the truth of the matter is  its completely useless  due to proportional representation  there is no chance that  veritas  will have any chance in claiming power  and change the two-horse race trend. in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke-screen for his anti-islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television.  i think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many. it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue. in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy -silk opposing geoff hoon!!  good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done. let s hope kilroy-silk  ukip and the euro-sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe. we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu  we need to be at the heart of europe  leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go  not running away from it.  all mouth and trousers. a clown. trouble is  any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into a third term.  whatever kilroy-silk and ukip do  none of their anti-european policies have any relevance outside middle england. this new party might gain support from right-wing england  but will have little impact in wales or scotland.  hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue. england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better  we can t rely on the usa forever!  at last an impetus for increasing the likely 40% turn out for the election. the electorate is disillusioned with british politics. kilroy has one agenda - the uk - and i ll be voting for him.  both ukip and rk-s are representatives of small-mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind. the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people s bickering that who  in the overall scheme of things  really cares about their petty tiff   many people believe you kilroy. you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility.  the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating. one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls.  i ve always thought that kilroy-silk was a self-publicising  egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion.  brilliant  about time this country had a plausible party!  having seen the recent bbc 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroy-silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people. hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action.  fantastic news. pro-europeans now have far less to worry about from the right. the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid-1990s  and the extreme anti-europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local  european and general elections. robert kilroy-silk s ego and vanity are his own (and his supporters ) worst enemy.  as a euro-enthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroy-silk s behaviour. he took a party that was just building up a head of steam  and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup-d etat  he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two. the closer to straight-down-the-middle the better  as far as i am concerned  but in any eventuality  the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other.  if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose  we d have ballot papers a mile long! you ve got to hand it to kilroy-silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief.  whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership  and like him i am also leaving ukip. i believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means. the eu s comments last week about michael howard s plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member states. the sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better  does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro-sceptic kilroy-silk has used a latin name for his new party  rather than a  good old british  name  is this indicative of the man - contradictory  vain and pompous   i think mr kilroy-silk has got a very good point. british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians. they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power. as a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped. if mr kilroy-silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.  honestly  who really cares  man with tan leaves party with no plan  to set up party with no idea.  as one of kilroy-silk s east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity. i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament.  ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk  but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him. someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukip s democratic nature.  kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician  in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not. he tried to make it work  but they didn t seem to want to grow up. he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media. this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy. good luck to the man  i say.  oh please! this is an amusing irrelevance. there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive  eurosceptic  argument. they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed  more democratic  more dynamic europe union. future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness.  the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open  honest and straight. what other politician can claim this. i have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like. i shall be voting for him.  the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy-silk but for the ukip. kilroy-silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip s party list. he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament.  i wouldn t write off kilroy-silk. while he s a clown and a one man band at the moment  he s a populist and that s always dangerous.the man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters  that seems to be one of the factors in success.  good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.  the man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv  could well turn out to be my country s knight in shining armour. he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today - but people are almost too scared to express them. kilroy silk has secured my vote  and many more like me. what s more  i look forward to the day when he claims victory  wrecks the eu  and rescues my great nation... without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever!  great stuff. the longer the uk dithers over europe  the richer we in ireland become  as the only english-speaking country fully committed to europe. oh and send us over those hard-working immigrants - our economy needs them.  this is just what the europhiles pray for. as the main eurosceptic party  ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe. having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.  thank goodness that kilroy-silk has gone - now ukip at least has a chance in the election!  it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip. robert kilroy-silk could have a lot to offer. instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. under the present electoral system  people must work together  and small parties have no hope of representation. last summer  ukip achieved a major advance  partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk. it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.  ukip has a wide platform of policies  not just withdrawal from the eu. this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk.  if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.  so ukip was good enough for him to lead  not good enough for him to follow!  interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name!  every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-europe feeling in this country. kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. we wants quality schools  top hospitals  clean and efficient public transport  punishments that fit the crime  limited asylum  a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. it needs courage and honesty  two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities. recruit the right colleagues  robert  and your time may have come!  well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party. it s all flash and no real policy here  let s hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slipping into obscurity.  veritas  the name will doom it. but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not  the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism  so explain to me how the too-twee label of veritas symbolises that']\n",

 best song in the last 25 years  what a joke! think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels. phil collins doesn t deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote  angels is an overrated song  that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it. soppy rubbish at best. hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon  and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards.  so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today  for me it s proof that music and democracy just don t mix. still  at least it wasn t will young...  oh it s all just a bit of fun. people take these awards too seriously! robbie has millions of loyal fans  while even non-fans know the words to angels. him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards. personally i wanted will young to win  but that was not really due to his musical talent!  i hate the song  all it brings back is memories of school discos and no-one to slow-dance with!  i agree about angels. i never get fed up hearing it. whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up  smile and sing along (very badly  that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out). the song makes me calm and serene and happy. well done robbie.  i think that although robbie williams is a good performer  that angels isn t really that good a song. it certainly isn t anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush.  angels is a fantastic song. all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers. it s a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.  robbie did in no way deserve that mantle. whenever we have these awards it is always  artists  from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...we forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example. they weren t cool at the time  but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.  yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years  because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.  i ve always disliked angels intensely. i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre-teens  teens and middle aged women to accept low quality/ low aspirational music as  classic  songwriting. it s  orrible. it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who don t particularly like music all that much. folks without collections; folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music. angels adds nothing - it is merely an irritating distraction - a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer s afternoon picnic. what a dreadful result. if you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don t you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote. booo hisss  angels  best song  you are kidding  right  last five years i might be willing to accept  but 25  no way. did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to  say  1995  really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century.  no surprise about robbie williams considering the list. where on earth did the nominations list come from     compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps   i mean  will young  come on.  what a load of crap  best song in the last 25 years - i don t think so!! what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless  but robbie williams doesn t even come close.  what a joke. that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word  angels  where i thrash around  and scream  no no no no no  until someone tells me  the radio s off . why a half-baked cheesy ditty like angels  which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example  and by whom)  should be voted the best song of the past 25 years  is beyond me. if this is the song against which all others are judged  then musicians may as well give up.  why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country   the initial list was very weak anyway  but angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!! i think not  i didn t realize radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10!!  people have such short memories! a great song yes  but the best of the last 25 years  not a chance. i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.  the great british public at work again. it s a mediocre  sentimental and safe song. granted  it s not too bad  either. but can it stand up against anything by the smiths (in particular  how soon is now  ) or anything from the stone roses  first album  nope.  no  because i m not female and i m not 10!  ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song. but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years! the shortlist wasn t great but him winning it is a joke!  predictable and laughable.  the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years. the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed. whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie s repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years.  i am a huge robbie fan and love that song. but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today  unfortunately they were left out of the list.  have radio 2 listeners even heard of joy division  a band who  through two albums  have had a bigger impact on music  and continue to do so  over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will.  no doubt about it. there s not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling. some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances  but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.  it should have been joy division.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song. i sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now  the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds  the beatles and nick drake have done for music today.  yes!! i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people. there were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win! robbie was a deserved winner.  i am astounded that such a second-rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs! it s a terrible song  voted for by the masses who don t have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music.  the best song of the past 25 years  really  come on  this is surely a joke  no  i think i need a long lie down...  it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division. i suppose it s confirmed one thing - the british public are consistently dull :- &lt;(  no offence robbie  but pleeease! there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids. no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music  and a further nail in the coffin!  i think robbie deserves it  he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide. anybody who says he doesn t deserve it is jealous of his success. the only real challenger was queen but hey  another one bites the dust!!  obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it.  if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble. sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material  but this is not the best record.  a sad day for music  it s not the type of music i normally like  but even as a diehard rock fan  i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people. that s why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years. it s a good all-rounder. just like robbie.  best song in 25 years  since 1980  i m confused.  angels  isn t a bad song. it s a nice  catchy  formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes. but this is not great music. if anything it s regressive. bland even. i suppose it s just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become.  granted angels is a good song  however it really wasn t up against any other proper competition. the queen s song was lackluster  and apart from kate bush  the other choices were pathetic! also  why weren t the stones there  david bowie  etc  there are so many greater songs than angels...i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn t getting more awards so they had to make one up for him!  best song of the last 25 years  what a ridiculuous concept  and an even more ridiculous winner. sigh. on the upside  at least it wasn t bohemian rhapsody  for which we should all be thankful.  angels is without doubt a great song but i really don t think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies  goodlooks than the actual song!!! don t get me wrong  i m not disputing his looks  but there are more deserved winners.  it would have been a travesty had angels not won. without angels  robbie williams may well not be where he is now  and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists. it has to be seen performed live  with 125 000 people singing along to be fully appreciated. well done rob.  i find it hard to believe that  angels  is the best we have to show for the past 25 years! i m rapidly redifining  best  in my own head now to mean  most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning . what about britpop  blur  oasis  suede  pulp... not only making fantastic songs but also making changes  doing something different. why must  best  always come down to most commercially popular   i ve nothing against robbie  i actually like his music  but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year  the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales. the same goes with the scissor sisters  i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award  but the album comes no where near u2 s new record  neither are they in the same league. once again there have been some baffling discisions made  they are not for artisic reasons  but for profit.  no surprise really  it s voted for by the general public. since when did they have taste in music   personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard!  it absolutely deserved to win. it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.  it s an absolute joke  however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well. all in all a pretty pointless exercise !  the song is overplayed and oversentimental. out of the rather poor five choices that were left  it should have gone to either joy division or queen. i suppose we should be thankful that it didn t end up in the hands of will young though.  although it has nostalgia value  there is no way it deserved to win. everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody  nothing compares 2 u  etc. much better songs and more timeless. give it to someone with real talent.  although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years. this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye. why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that s all it means!']\n",

or forget - for athletics.      one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly s success in the 800m.  winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. kelly had been full of  should i  shouldn t i   thoughts about going for the double in athens. i thought why wouldn t you do the 800m  it s your best event  it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story.      the victory for the british men s 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games. i think the four of them - jason gardener  darren campbell  marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake.      hicham el guerrouj s olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly s on a global scale.  he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5 000m titles. as soon as he had added the 5 000m crown and i had finished commentating  i jumped up  ran down the stairs  pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories. hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with  even though my french and his english are not very good.      what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood. dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10 000m five days later was not wise. that was her heart and not her head reacting. paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.  things like niggling injuries  not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained. and if even the smallest thing doesn t feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon  10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. the positive thing to take from paula s olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me.      purely as a race  paula s victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. it was so nip-and-tuck between her and kenya s susan chepkemei and you don t usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because  to use one of my favourite words  paula showed real  bouncebackability . and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out.      kelly and the 4x100m boys  victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team. we should be concerned that we re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level.  the only individual men s finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m. i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed  and that s where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy. dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb. the thing is if we don t have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn t look good for the beijing olympics and beyond.      i tell you what i really enjoyed this year  benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march. in the absence of paula  we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve. so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special.      to be honest  i m getting bored with all the drug scandals  especially balco. i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.  having said that  i m always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou  well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while. the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.']\n",

Â£6bn) to its budget by 2014  according to a recent impact study by the country s state planning organisation. as turkey s gross domestic output (gdp) is set to grow by 6% per year on average  its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020. turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in  old europe  once its population comes of age. by 2014  one in four turks - or about 18 million people - will be aged 14 or less.  a literate and qualified turkish population   insisted mr sener   will make a positive impact on the eu.   this runs contrary to the popular view that turkey is getting ready to dig deep into eu taxpayers  wallets. however  turkey s assertions are confirmed by brussels  own impact studies  which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy. but only over time. costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey s membership  with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and  according to some predictions  balloon to 33.5bn euros. this would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid  though such payments should decline as the country s farm sector  which currently employs one in three turks  would employ just one in five by 2020.  such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkey s government would never be delivered  say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned.  some fear that rather than providing an educated  sophisticated labour force for europe at large  the people who will leave turkey to seek work abroad will be poor  uneducated - and plentiful. more recently  less palatable concerns - at least in liberal european circles - have been voiced  with senior eu or member state officials talking darkly of a  river of islam   an  oriental  culture and a threat to europe s  cultural richness . of course  many opponents are politically motivated - their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country s muslim traditions to well-documented concerns about the government s human rights record. yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand.  critics insist that much of the optimism about turkey s economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the country s current account deficit to $10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year.  the country s massive debt - which includes $23bn owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu.  in the new member states of the european union  gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product   says reza moghadam  assistant director of the imf s european department.  at about 80% of gdp  turkey s gross debt is double that figure.  turkey s debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country s devastating recession.  there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past  it remains quite vulnerable   says michael deppler  director of the imf s european department.  its debt is far too high for an emerging economy.  a key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria. but economics is not a science. and although the state of turkey s economy is important  as is its pace of reform  the final decision on 17 december will be taken by politicians who will  of course  be guided by their political instincts.']\n",

or indeed time - is on the screen. the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman  the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half-life. having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility  he s back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic city 17. it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city  but as soon as your train pulls in to the station  it s clear that all is not well here. sinister police patrol the unkempt streets  and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer. a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be.  you are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom-fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task. it is not immediately explained what your objectives are  nor precisely why everything is so ravaged. finding out step-by-step is all part of the experience  although you never fully get to understand what it was all about. that does not really matter. hl2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot. underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective  and immerses the player in the most vivid  convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen. there are no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow. exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you.  whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride  wandering through half-life s world truly does feel like being part of a movie.  considering its sophistication  the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications. but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc s components  this is it. on our test machine - an alienware system with an athlon 3500+ processor and ati s radeon x800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble  and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping. it is not simply that the surfaces  textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy  but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them. the haunting  grim landscapes become strangely beautiful. luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings. so impressive are the physics that you ll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move. there are puzzles to be solved along the way  pitched at about the right difficulty  but most progress is achieved by force. freeman is quickly reunited with the original game s famous crowbar  and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow.  virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with  and in realistic fashion. you will be wowed by the attention-to-detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls  chase a pigeon out of your way  or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed. at times half-life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to  and in a curious way  its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome. running around on foot is great enough  but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun. human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones. the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles. in gameplay terms  hl2 somehow gets almost everything perfect. and without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of doom iii  it s all incredibly unsettling. the vacant environment is distinctly eerie  and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside.  the game does have a couple of problems. firstly  the carefully-scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people.  a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue  which makes for exciting moments  but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you ve completed it. if you like things open-ended and free-ranging  far cry will be a lot more pleasing. but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run. installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saint s patience. developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy. the box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure  but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded. the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed  the temperamental valve servers and the time of day  but it can take hours. it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily  half-life 2 is up to the challenge. it is surely the best thing in its genre  and possibly  many will feel  of any genre. the bar has been raised  and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.  half-life 2 is out now for the pc']\n",

points. but roddick saves them and then earns one himself. nadal comes up with a down-the-line winner but then nets tamely on roddick s next set point.  nadal s nerve is tested as he tries to force a tiebreak. both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide.  a pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points. the point of the match so far involves roddick s slam-dunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally. on the very next point  nadal blasts a forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud. but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game.  nadal outplays roddick to reach 40-0 but the american fights back to 40-30 before nadal s powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game.  the crowd are getting very involved  cheering between roddick s first and second serves. but the american comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set.  nadal manages to hold again despite roddick piling the pressure on his serve. the spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord.  roddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure. a well-placed serve is unreturnable and roddick holds.  a powerful ace down the middle gives nadal a simple love service game - the first time he has held serve so far in the match. if roddick didn t know before  he knows now that he is in a real contest.  another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof. he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows. four of the first five games have seen a break of serve.  despite the disappointment of losing his serve  roddick is not phased and storms into a 40-15 lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm a close line-call. nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again with a sharp volley at the net.  roddick s advantage is short lived as nadal breaks back immediately. a fortunate net cord helps the spaniard on his way and when roddick fires a forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve  nadal pumps his fist in celebration.  the american is pumped up for this clash and takes on nadal s serve from the start. nadal s drop shot is agonisingly called out and

about 98%. so if you have anything that allows more space  you don t have to compress so hard.  studios could fit a lot more marketing material  games  and features  onto high-capacity dvds. currently  an entire dvd project can take up to three months  says mr dean. although the step of down-converting will be bypassed  this will realistically only save a day s work  says mr dean. one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems. on the fairly complex star wars disks  making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone. if studios want to cash in on the extra space  it could mean extra human hours  for which someone has to pay.  if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks  it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required.  and if studios do focus on delivering more  added value content   thinks mr dean  ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd. but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price  studios will listen  thinks mr dean.  high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike. more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous.  when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i  everybody was very sun-tanned  but that was make-up.  in the hd version of episode i  all these make-up lines showed up   explains mr dean. the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too.   there are scans of a corridor [on the death star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots  there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways.  you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn t see it.  what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas  this line blurs even further. it could also mean that how we get films  and in what format  will widen.  in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip [internet protocol -

even the ones that use 3d graphics.  the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. many titles  particularly racing games  let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a  ghost  or  shadow  to see if you can beat them. a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or  if you are sitting close to them  via bluetooth short-range radio technology. with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing.   too fast too furious (digital bridges)   as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games - because i m rubbish at them. no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. winning gives you cash for upgrades. graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play.   fatal force (macrospace)   a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth. graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. both background music and sounds effects work well. the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders. weapons include flamethrowers  rocket launchers  grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. with the right power-up you can go into a matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range. online the game has quite a following with clans  player rankings and even new downloadable maps.']\n",

just over the road from their modern day home.  just 250 guests attended with ticket prices at $5.  the first film to win was wings  which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. for the first 10 years or so  the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm  but in 1940 the winners were published in the los angeles times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced  leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner.  the ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous grauman s chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event. other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium. they are now held at the kodak theatre  which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6 000 people. until 1954 they were held on a thursday  then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on  although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february. the first televised ceremony was in 1953  with bob hope as the mc. who was oscar  there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscar.  one popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar. a journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article.  the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburn s first best actress win in 1934. the academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939. the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons. since its inception 2 530 oscars have been handed out. in support of the war effort  the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii. after the war  winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000  52 were recovered nine days later. winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. who sits in judgement  the academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines. douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. there are now 5 700 members of the academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy  receipt of an academy award nomination  achievement of unique distinction  earning of special merit  or making an outstanding contribution to film. the stars who left empty-handed while many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the academy  there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics.  among the overlooked films were hobson s choice  dirty harry  the 39 steps  the searchers and king kong. actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer (1927)  humphrey bogart in casablanca (1944)  gene kelly in singing in the rain (1952) and henry fonda in 12 angry men (1957). alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968. the show always goes on not even war has halted the glittering hollywood event. there were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in iraq  but as it didn t stop during world war ii or the vietnam war.  documentary winner michael moore ensured nobody forgot about the iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the american invasion. the ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. the ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. los angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week. the death of martin luther king saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on president ronald reagan. controversies and other gaffes three people have refused oscars  including actor george c scott who said the whole thing was  demeaning . writer dudley nichols refused his academy award in 1935 for his screenplay for the insider because the writers  guild was striking at the time. marlon brando turned down his best actor oscar for the godfather in 1973 in protest as hollywood s apparent discrimination against native american people. he sent along a woman called sacheen littlefeather to collect his award. she was later revealed to be native american actress maria cruz.  the following year robert opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked  flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. the tv network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. opal was murdered in 1979. frank capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared  come on up and get it  frank  to which frank capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant frank lloyd had won for cavalcade.  capra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for it happened one night.']\n",

the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of  real  voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras. the theory is that talking to the great british public  even if they are the  great unwashed   is better than having the media filter what voters hear from politicians. it is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real people s concerns and - on occasions - of their outright fury. mr blair used the tactic before the iraq war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the run-up to the election.  labour knows it has been damaged by accusations of spin   control freakery  and over-slick presentation - sometimes from within the ranks of its own mps. tony blair himself has said people complain he does not listen. mr blair s latest bout of flagellation came with a series of questions sessions on five television throughout wednesday.  the trouble began on the wright stuff show  with maria hutchings marching up to him  saying  tony  that s rubbish  as she tried to complain about her autistic son s school being threatened with closure. a few  don t worries  as mrs hutchings was led back to the audience averted a public slanging match - he spoke to her privately after the show. but that was only the start and later sessions produced the type of grilling not even the toughest television interviewer could produce.  writer neil coppendale  from west sussex  asked of the iraq war:  tens of thousands of innocent men  women and children died -

and sometimes threw them off their stride by asking what they would do about the problems. many of the newspapers have branded the exercise a pr stunt which backfired. indeed there is a danger mr blair simply ends up looking  embattled . conservative michael howard and liberal democrat charles kennedy are to be offered chances to appear in similar slots on the channel next month. labour strategists believe more of the sessions will mean the hecklers no longer become a story and the real issues take prominence.  james humphreys  ex-head of corporate communications at number 10  says the strategy shows frustration with the media.  they feel they don t get their voice across and going direct to people is clearly their game on this occasion   he says. there are risks but the prize is tackling the trend of lower turnouts at the polls  he argues. the prime minister knows full well the potential hazards .  he must remember with gritted teeth his confrontation with sharron storer  the birmingham woman who harangued him over the state of her local hospital in the 2001 election campaign.  all you do is walk around and make yourself known  you don t do anything to help anybody   she told mr blair before stomping off  refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately. former downing street media chief alastair campbell has described the episode as a  bit of a disaster  as it meant the launch of labour s election manifesto received little coverage. but it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive  not least because it coincided with john prescott s even more direct contact - when he punched an egg-throwing protester.  former prime ministers too have come to grief at the hands of a persistent member of the public. the undoubted highlight of years of election phone-in shows was margaret thatcher discomfort on nationwide in 1983  when viewer diana gould put her on the spot about the sinking of the belgrano in the falklands war. john major reaped the benefits of street campaigning during the 1992 election campaign with his famous soapbox.  it may have left him splattered with eggs and engine oil at times but he felt it added  fizz  to his campaign. in his memoirs  he also argues the strategy contrasted with neil kinnock s  contrived photo opportunities  and attempts at an artful campaign.  he wanted to look like a prime minister. i  was  prime minister and i wanted a flesh and blood fight   says mr major. mr blair told prospective labour mps on thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could  enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment . but he also wants to counter complaints that he has spent too much time on international affairs and foreign trips. mr blair recalls how bill clinton once advised him:  always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day.  his hope must be that voters watching him on the rack will bear out for labour the old maxim:  no pain  no gain.']\n",

our identities. armed with the personal details that a bank holds  plus a fake letter or two  it is apparently easy to get a loan  open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else s name. and it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving. identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime  and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills  receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish.  but  however careful you may be  if the organisations you trust with your personal data  bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble. it is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well-placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system. in fact  i suspect that the fsa is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time. has anyone checked bob cratchit s family links to the criminal underworld  i wonder  and it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted. health authorities  government agencies and of course the big e-commerce sites like amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters. the good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to. and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements  banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details. fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office  plugging it into a usb slot and sucking down customer files.  companies like securewave  for example  can restrict the use of usb ports just to authorised devices or even to an individual s personal memory card. these solutions are not perfect  but it does not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system. however the warning does highlight one of the major issues with e-commerce and online trading - the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the  back office . it has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked.  in fact i do not know of a single case where an e-mail containing payment details has led to card fraud.  there are simply too many e-mails passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud. cd universe  powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences. and just last week the online bank cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name. whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job  the issue is the same: how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused  any organisation that processes personal data is  of course  bound by the data protection act and must take proper care of it. unauthorised disclosure is not allowed  but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice. this is not something we can just leave it to the market. the consequences of having one s identity stolen are too serious  and markets respond too slowly. after all  i bank with cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that i did not even consider it when i heard about their security problems. i doubt many others have closed their accounts  especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future. the two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law  so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes  or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft. i have never felt comfortable with the us practice of suing everything that moves  partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients  so i know which i d prefer.  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.']\n",

up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks. the system is not available commercially yet  but motorola  the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker  held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access)  a high-speed  high bandwidth technology available now. early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second (mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (kbps) on standard 3g networks.   high-speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) - sometimes called super 3g - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips   according to a report published by uk-based research consultancy analysys. a number of companies are developing the technology. nokia and canada-based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access. the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers.   while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14mbps  practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks   said dr alastair brydon  author of the analysys report: pushing beyond the limits of 3g with hsdpa and other enhancements.  the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which  even at this lower rate  will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic wcdma [3g]   he added. motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3g cell using a single hsdpa device. but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution  data optimised (ev-do).  us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3g network at the end of last year. we are  expanding our network and deploying ev-do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds   said oliver valente  sprint s vice president for technology development  when the contract was announced. as part of $3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year  sprint will spend around $1bn on ev-do technology from lucent technologies  nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits a second  and peak download rates of 2.4mbps. mmo2  the uk-based operator with services in the uk  ireland and germany  has opted for technology based on hsdpa. using technology from lucent  it will offer data speeds of 3.6mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network  and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4mbps. us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa  using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson.  siemens  plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today  but christoph caselitz  president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that:  by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015  the need for transmission capacities for voice  data  image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10.  siemens - in collaboration with the fraunhofer german-sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae  instead of the usual one. this enables a data transmission  such as sending a big file or video  to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. the speeds offered by 3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences. but today  instead of connecting to the internet by slow  dial-up phone connection  many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second - much faster than 3g. this means users are likely to find 3g disappointing unless the networks are souped up. if they aren t  those lucrative  power users   such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks  reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory  it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials. a commercial system could be as far away as 2012  though siemens did not rule out an earlier date.']\n",

            "['politics', 'how political squabbles snowball it s become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering.  but this analysis in fact gets it wrong. it s not just children who fight - adults do too. and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going. the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they d be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word.  each participant genuinely wants the row to stop  but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on. (in the case of mr blair and mr brown  successive books are published  ensuring the issues never die.) now this isn t because the participants are stupid - it s actually each individual behaving entirely rationally  given the incentives facing them. indeed  there s even a piece of economic theory that explains all this. nothing as obscure as  post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory  which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.  it s often referred to as the  prisoner s dilemma   based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners. the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime  and are locked up in separate cells. but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them  to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime. without a confession  the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge.  clearly the prisoners  best strategy is to keep their mouths shut  and take the short sentence  but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk. he tells each prisoner separately  that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they ll be let off their crime. and he tells them that if they don t confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they ll get life. now  if you are prisoner confronted with this choice  your best bet is to confess. if your partner doesn t confess  you ll get off completely. and if your partner does confess  you d better confess to ensure you don t get life. the result is of course  both prisoners confess  so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. both prisoners  individual logic was to behave that way  even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. don t worry if you don t entirely follow it - you can to look it up on google  where there are 283 000 entries on it.  the prisoners  dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades. it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively  but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly.  a cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms  rather than a lot of arms. but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other  an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms  results in arms levels that are too high. what economics tells us is that once you re in a prisoners  dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it s hard to escape the perverse logic of it. it s no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms  or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on. somehow  the incentives have to change.  in the case of the labour party  if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest  solomon s wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments  solutions which affect the incentives of the participants. an example  is the famous rule that  one divides  the other chooses  as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children. in the case of an apparently endless argument  if you want it to come to an end  you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing  or one more book for that matter  has to exceed the benefit of having the last word  and getting your point in. if the rest of the party can enforce that  they ll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.']\n",
